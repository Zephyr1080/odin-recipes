    <ol>
        <li>For making tomato puree to use in red sauce. Use tomatoes that has a natural sweet taste to it. Take tomatoes and chop them into pieces, add them to a blender and make it into a fine puree. Donâ€™t add water when grinding. Set aside till use.</li>
        <li>In a heavy bottom pan with a lid. Add in olive oil and turn on the heat. Use good quality olive oil for better flavour. You can even use butter.</li>
        <li>Add in chopped garlic and let them heat through for 1 minute till garlic gets fragrant. </li>
        <li>Now add in tomato paste to the garlic oil and cook for 2 to 3 minutes till it gets caramelised and raw smell leaves from it. </li>
        <li>Now you can see oil separating form the mixture and the tomato paste has fried in the oil. </li>
        <li>Now pour in the freshly made tomato puree. If you cannot find fresh tomatoes, you can use canned or tinned tomatoes. In that case, opt for canned whole tomatoes rather than crushed tomatoes. Whole canned tomatoes has better flavour than crushed tomatoes or tomato puree.</li>
        <li>Pour in the freshly made tomato puree and mix well into the garlic and oil. </li>
        <li>Once it is mixed well, cover with a lid and cook on medium high heat for 8 to 10 minutes. The raw smell from the tomatoes should be cooked. </li>
        <li>After few minutes of cooking, open the lid, give a good mix. </li>
        <li>Place it inside a 200 degree C preheated oven and bake for 10 minutes until the cheese is melted and bubbly. </li>
